## PROJECTS

### Amazon Product Sentiment Analysis using VADER and RoBERTa 
**October 2024 - November 2024**
* Conducted sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing tools on Amazon product reviews by implementing a data pipeline leveraging the LLM RoBERTa (transformer-based model) and VADER (lexicon-based model)
* Enhanced model accuracy by 35% by leveraging transfer learning with transformer-based RoBERTa
* Analyzed strengths and limitations in detecting neutral sentiments, with a focus on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
* Derived insights to inform potential refinements in e-commerce review analysis, enabling better customer satisfaction
assessments and improved product recommendations
