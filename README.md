## PROJECTS
### Analyzing Airbnb Listings and the Development Price Prediction Models in New York City	

**January 2024 – May 2024**
* Conducted statistical analysis to develop price prediction models for Airbnb listings in New York City
*	Created data visualizations and analyzed spatial patterns from Airbnb listings using Geopandas in Python
*	Developed and fine-tuned predictive models (SVR, Decision Trees, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost) for Airbnb prices
*	Achieved high model accuracy with R-squared values of 77.36% for RF Regressor and 80.36% for XGBoost Regressor

### Cat and Dog Image Classification Using Transfer Learning from TensorFlow and PyTorch	

**November 2023 – December 2023**
*	Resized 25000 images of cats and dogs using the `torchvision` library from PyTorch to input images of the same dimension 
*	Designed and implemented a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture in both TensorFlow and PyTorch 
*	Applied transfer learning using the InceptionV3 pre-trained model in TensorFlow and the ResNet18 pre-trained model in PyTorch to perform binary classification of 25000 images containing cats and dogs
*	Best performing model was the InceptionV3 TensorFlow Model with a validation accuracy of 98.58%

### Factors Determining Airline Passenger Satisfaction using Google Cloud Platform	

**April 2023 – May 2023**
* Stored a file of 129880 survey responses into a bucket on Google Cloud Storage, queried the file using SQL Workspace in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and loaded the data onto Google Colab using BigQuery API for data analysis and visualization
* Performed feature selection and transformation to determine attributes that have a greater impact on airline satisfaction

### Predictive Analysis for Diabetes Diagnosis

**April 2023 – May 2023**
* Collaborated as a team of three using Jupyter Notebook (Python) and Machine Learning algorithms including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees to predict whether someone has diabetes
* Achieved an accuracy of 95.13% and F-Score of 75.13% from the Logistic Regression model
