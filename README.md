# [Christina Hyman's Portfolio](https://christina-hyman.github.io/portfolio/)

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Check out my portfolio using the link: [https://christina-hyman.github.io/portfolio/](https://christina-hyman.github.io/portfolio/)

My portfilio is built using the [Cayman Jekyll Theme for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman)

I customized the following elements from the default theme:
- Updated the layout and design to include my headshot in the header and remove Github downloads/hyperlinks.
- Modified the `default.html` layout to adjust the header, font colors, and content organization.
- Integrated links of my email, phone number, background and various projects on the `index.md` file.

Feel free to explore my projects and contact me for collaborations or job opportunities!
