# PROJECTS {#projects}

### Amazon Product Sentiment Analysis using VADER and RoBERTa 
**October 2024 - November 2024**
* Conducted sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing tools on Amazon product reviews by implementing a data pipeline leveraging the LLM RoBERTa (transformer-based model) and VADER (lexicon-based model)
* Enhanced model accuracy by 35% by leveraging transfer learning with transformer-based RoBERTa
* Analyzed strengths and limitations in detecting neutral sentiments, with a focus on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
* Derived insights to inform potential refinements in e-commerce review analysis, enabling better customer satisfaction assessments and improved product recommendations

### Job Postings Data Analysis using SQL and Tableau
**September 2024 - October 2024**
* Conducted in-depth analysis of 787686 job postings data from the year 2023 to uncover key trends in hiring for various data-related professions, including Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts
* Developed SQL queries to extract insights on monthly job posting trends, daily variations in postings by time of day (focused on EST), and the most in-demand skills across different job titles
* Analyzed salary data to identify common skills associated with the highest-paying Data Scientist roles and determined the top companies with the most job postings for data-related positions
* Utilized PostgreSQL and Tableau to create interactive visualizations for presenting findings, including packed bubble charts and bar charts highlighting skill demand and profession-specific trends

### Analyzing Airbnb Listings and the Development Price Prediction Models in New York City	
**January 2024 – May 2024**
* Conducted statistical analysis to develop price prediction models for Airbnb listings in New York City
* Created data visualizations and analyzed spatial patterns from Airbnb listings using Geopandas in Python
* Determined the causal effect of NYC’s enforcement of Local Law 18 using the Difference-in-Differences method
* Developed and fine-tuned predictive models (SVR, Decision Trees, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost) for Airbnb prices
* Achieved high model accuracy with R-squared values of 77.36% for RF Regressor and 80.36% for XGBoost Regressor

### Cat and Dog Image Classification Using Transfer Learning from TensorFlow and PyTorch	
**November 2023 – December 2023**
* Resized 25000 images of cats and dogs using the `torchvision` library from PyTorch to input images of the same dimension 
* Designed and implemented a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture in both TensorFlow and PyTorch 
* Applied transfer learning using the InceptionV3 pre-trained model in TensorFlow and the ResNet18 pre-trained model in PyTorch to perform binary classification of 25000 images containing cats and dogs
* Best performing model was the InceptionV3 TensorFlow Model with a validation accuracy of 98.58%

### Factors Determining Airline Passenger Satisfaction using Google Cloud Platform	
**April 2023 – May 2023**
* Analyzed the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" datasets from Kaggle using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to identify factors influencing passenger satisfaction
* Uploaded and managed 129,880 survey responses in Google Cloud Storage, combined train and test datasets with SQL queries in BigQuery, and loaded data into Google Colab via the BigQuery API
* Visualized insights and relationships between factors in Google Colab using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
* Performed feature selection and transformation using Python's scikit-learn and determined key attributes on airline satisfaction, which are Seat Comfort, Inflight Entertainment, and On-Board Service
